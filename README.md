# HaskellDDS

An OpenSplice DDS binding for Haskell, or more precisely, a proof-of-concept binding that is essentially the author’s first significant body of Haskell code and as such is without any pretense of idiomatic or elegant use of the language, and as a proof-of-concept simply ignores the question of what a proper mapping of OMG IDL to Haskell would be, instead opting for an ad-hoc solution that works for the simple cases the author has tried it in.

See “dds” for the binding, “dds-examples” for a few simple examples.  Both are built as part of this stack project.
